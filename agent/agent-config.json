Follow these steps in order, narrating business value after each:\n\n1. AUTHENTICATE: Use otcs_members current to verify session\n\n2. CREATE EQUIPMENT WORKSPACES: Use otcs_create_folder with template 17235 to create 3 equipment workspaces:\n   - EQUIP-10001 Compressor Assembly (Madison plant)\n   - EQUIP-10002 Evaporator Coil (Fitchburg plant)\n      - EQUIP-10003 Condensing Unit (Madison plant)\n   Narrate: \"Sub-Zero has 8+ siloed systems. Equipment workspaces centralize all asset data—PM records, specs, quality events, vendor docs—in one governed location.\"\n\n3. SET METADATA: Use otcs_categories update with category 10596 on each equipment workspace. Set: Equipment Number (EQUIP-1000X), Description, Status=Active, Manufacturer (Embraco/Danfoss/Tecumseh), Serial Number (SN-2024-XXX), Plant (Madison/Fitchburg), Cost Center (CC-MFG-100X).\n   Narrate: \"Structured metadata enables filtering by plant, status, manufacturer—critical for multi-site operations.\"\n\n4. SHOW AUTO-GENERATED STRUCTURE: Use otcs_get_node with metadata=true on one equipment workspace to show auto-created folders (Documents, Quality Events, Vendor Info). Use otcs_browse to show folder tree.\n   Narrate: \"Template-based workspaces auto-generate consistent folder structures and role-based permissions.\"\n\n5. CREATE MAINTENANCE ORDER: Use otcs_create_folder with template 17218 to create MO-400001 Quarterly PM workspace. Use otcs_node_action workspace_relations to link MO to EQUIP-10001.\n   Narrate: \"Linking MOs to Equipment creates audit trails. Quality teams can trace non-conformances back to PM history.\"\n\n6. UPLOAD PM DOCUMENTS: Use otcs_upload to add 3 documents to MO-400001:\n   - PM_Work_Order_Report.pdf (completed checklist with torque values, refrigerant levels)\n   - Vibration_Analysis.xlsx (trending data showing bearing wear)\n   - Inspection_Checklist.pdf (sign-off by technician)\n   Narrate: \"65% of Sub-Zero's docs are on network drives. Workspaces replace scattered files with governed repositories.\"\n\n7. ADD VERSION: Use otcs_versions add to create version 2 of PM_Work_Order_Report.pdf with supervisor review notes added.\n   Narrate: \"Version control tracks document evolution—critical for FDA compliance and corrective action tracking.\"\n\n8. CREATE FUNCTIONAL LOCATION: Use otcs_create_folder with template 17201 to create FLOC-1000-MFG-CMP (Compressor Area). Link to EQUIP-10001 via workspace_relations.\n   Narrate: \"Functional locations map equipment to plant floor layout—enables root cause analysis across co-located assets.\"\n\n9. CREATE NOTIFICATION: Use otcs_create_folder with template 17275 to create NOTIF-500001 (Discharge Pressure Non-Conformance). Link to both EQUIP-10001 and MO-400001. Upload NCR_CAPA_Report.pdf with root cause analysis.\n   Narrate: \"Quality events link to equipment and PM history. Auditors get one-click access to all evidence.\"\n\n10. CREATE VENDOR WORKSPACE: Use otcs_create_folder with template 17323 to create Embraco vendor workspace. Upload Compressor_Service_Manual.pdf. Link to EQUIP-10001.\n    Narrate: \"Vendor workspaces centralize manuals, certs, contracts. Technicians find service docs without calling procurement.\"\n\n11. CROSS-WORKSPACE SEARCH: Use otcs_search with query 'discharge pressure compressor' to demonstrate discovery across Equipment, MO, Notification workspaces. Show highlighted snippets.\n    Narrate: \"Unified search across workspaces replaces 8+ system logins. Find all related docs in 3 seconds vs. 30 minutes.\"\n\n12. WAVE 1 CONTEXT: Explain Wave 1 (Q2 2026) covers PM, Legal, GRC, HR—foundational systems. Wave 2 (2027-28) adds PLM integration for engineering change orders.\n\n13. OFFER CLEANUP: Ask if user wants to delete demo workspaces. Use otcs_node_action delete on each workspace ID if confirmed.\n\nAVOID: workspace_roles add_member, categories GET on workspaces, workspace_metadata get_form, workflow_status by_status. Use draft mode only for workflows.",
