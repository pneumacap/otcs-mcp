# Altius Pitch Deck

**AI Automation Platform for Enterprise Content Management**

---

## Slide 1: Title + Hook

**ALTIUS**
*Intelligence at Scale for OpenText Content Server*

**The Problem We Solve:**
Enterprises have $200-300B locked in underutilized ECM systems. 70% of implementations failed to deliver ROI.

**The Solution:**
AI automation that unlocks existing investment — no migration required.

**The Market:**
1,000-1,500 OpenText enterprises with $3-7.5B in sunk costs, $200-300B stranded ECM investment globally.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Document-Intensive Work is Painfully Manual

**The Reality:**
- Knowledge workers spend **40-60% of time** on document handling
- Manual processes take **15-30 days** with **5-15% error rates**
- **$15-25 cost per transaction** in labor alone
- Legacy ECM systems require extensive training and custom development

**The Pain:**
- 🐌 **Slow cycle times** — Weeks for processes that should take hours
- 💸 **High operational costs** — Labor-intensive document routing and data entry
- ⚠️ **Compliance risks** — Manual processes miss retention requirements
- 📈 **Can't scale** — Volume increases require proportional headcount

**The Crisis:**
- 70% of digital transformation projects fail to achieve goals
- = $200-300B in stranded ECM investment over past 15 years
- Migration costs $100M+ and takes years
- Organizations need ROI from existing systems NOW

---

## Slide 3: Why Now?

### Three Market Shifts Create Perfect Timing

**1. AI Goes Mainstream (2024-2025)**
- ChatGPT made conversational AI acceptable to enterprises
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 enables accurate document understanding
- Executives now ask: "How do we use AI in *our* operations?"

**2. RPA Failed to Deliver**
- $3B+ spent on UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism
- 30-50% of RPA projects fail or abandoned
- Brittle, expensive to maintain, requires armies of developers

**3. ECM Investments Need ROI**
- $30B spent on enterprise content management
- Content Server deployments 10-15 years old
- No path to modernization without full migration ($$$ + years)

**The Gap:** $200-300B stranded in ECM systems. Migration costs $100M+ and takes years. Enterprises need AI automation that unlocks existing investment without migration.

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

### Altius — Three Products, One Platform

**🗣️ Conversational Interface**
- Natural language access to all Content Server operations
- "Find contracts expiring in Q1" → Instant results with charts
- Zero training required, works in browser

**🤖 Autonomous Agents**
- Monitor folders, classify documents, extract data
- Execute complex workflows automatically
- ~$0.01-0.03 per document processed

**🔌 Developer Tools**
- 41 pre-built integrations for Content Server
- Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, any AI agent
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard

**Key Differentiator:** Unlocks stranded ECM investment without migration. Purpose-built for OpenText Content Server — the only OTCS-native AI automation solution.

---

## Slide 5: User Experience — Why 70% of ECM Projects Fail

### Users Hate the Interface → No Adoption → No ROI

**LEGACY OTCS:**
- Complex navigation trees
- 20+ clicks to find documents
- Cryptic field names
- Requires weeks of training
- Users avoid the system
- 90s-era UI design
- **Result:** Low adoption = Failed ROI

**ALTIUS EXPERIENCE:**
- Natural language queries
- Instant search results
- Visual analytics & charts
- Zero training required
- Users prefer it over email
- Modern, delightful UI
- **Result:** 90%+ adoption = Realized ROI

### Four Conversational Interfaces

**🔍 Search**
- "Show me all contracts expiring in Q1 2026"
- AI understands natural language
- Instant results with metadata
- Charts, tables, export options

**📊 Analytics**
- "Show revenue trends from Q1 report"
- Extracts data from documents
- Generates charts automatically
- Interactive visualizations

**⚡ Workflows**
- "What approvals are waiting for me?"
- See all pending tasks instantly
- One-click approvals
- Full workflow history

**📄 Extraction**
- "Extract key terms from this contract"
- OCR + AI document understanding
- Structured metadata tables
- Copy, export, or auto-populate

**Key Insight:** UX = Adoption = ROI. Users choose Altius over legacy OTCS for every task. This solves the #1 reason ECM projects fail: poor user experience.

## Slide 6: How It Works

### From Manual to Autonomous in 3 Steps

**BEFORE ALTIUS:**
```
Document arrives
  ↓
Manual review (30-60 min)
  ↓
Data entry into system (15-20 min)
  ↓
Route to correct person (email, calls)
  ↓
Approval workflow (days/weeks)
  ↓
Manual compliance check
  ↓
File in correct location

Total: 15-30 days, $15-25 per document
Error rate: 5-15%
```

**WITH ALTIUS:**
```
Document arrives in watched folder
  ↓
AI extracts all fields (30 seconds)
  ↓
Classification + routing (automatic)
  ↓
Workflow started with pre-filled data
  ↓
Compliance holds applied automatically
  ↓
Stakeholders notified

Total: 2-5 minutes, $5-8 per document
Error rate: 0.5-2%
```

**Impact:** 70-80% faster, 60-70% lower cost, 90% fewer errors

---

## Slide 7: Use Case — Legal Discovery

### Real Example: Subpoena Response Automation

**Traditional Process (3-5 days):**
1. Legal team receives subpoena
2. Manually read 10-20 page document
3. Identify what records are requested
4. Email IT with search criteria
5. IT runs searches, sends results
6. Legal reviews 100-1000+ documents
7. Identify responsive documents
8. Apply legal hold manually
9. Package and share with external counsel

**Cost:** 40-80 hours of paralegal time ($3,000-6,000)

**With Altius (2 minutes):**
1. Upload subpoena to monitored folder
2. AI extracts: employee name, case number, document types requested
3. Automatically searches Content Server with optimized queries
4. Filters results by relevance (AI-powered)
5. Creates legal hold for the case
6. Applies hold to all responsive documents
7. Shares collection with external counsel
8. Logs all actions for audit trail

**Cost:** $0.10 in AI processing + 5 minutes review

**ROI:** 99.5% cost reduction, 2,000x faster

---

## Slide 8: Use Case — Contract Management

### Real Example: Contract Approval Automation

**Traditional Process (2-4 weeks):**
1. Contract received via email
2. Admin manually files in Content Server
3. Email to legal for review
4. Legal downloads, reads, analyzes
5. Legal fills out risk assessment form
6. Routes to appropriate approver based on value
7. Multiple approval rounds via email
8. Final approval, countersigning
9. Executed contract filed
10. Obligation tracking set up manually

**Cost:** 8-12 hours across 4-6 people ($800-1,200)

**With Altius (1 hour human time):**
1. Contract uploaded to intake folder
2. AI extracts: parties, value, terms, obligations, risks
3. Risk assessment performed automatically (financial, legal, operational)
4. Workflow started with pre-populated fields
5. Routed to correct approver based on value and type
6. Notifications sent automatically
7. Human reviews AI assessment and approves
8. Obligations added to tracking system
9. Full audit trail maintained

**Cost:** $0.15 in AI + 1 hour review

**Impact:** 90% time reduction, perfect audit trail, no contracts lost in email
