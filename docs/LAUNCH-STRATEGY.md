### Objection Handling

**Common objections and responses:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're already invested in OTCS workflows" | "Altius extends your OTCS investment, doesn't replace it. You keep your existing workflows and add AI automation on top." |
| "AI is too risky for compliance" | "Altius respects all OTCS permissions and audit trails. Every action is logged. We have customers in healthcare and financial services with strict compliance." |
| "We don't have budget this year" | "The ROI pays for itself in 1-2 months. Many customers fund it from operational budgets, not CapEx." |
| "We need to see it work first" | "That's what our POC is for. We'll process your real documents and prove the ROI before you commit." |
| "Can't we build this ourselves?" | "You could, but our customers tried that for 12-18 months with limited success. We offer 41 production-ready tools and proven workflows." |

## Funding Strategy

### Bootstrap vs Raise

**Current state:** Self-funded/bootstrapped

**Options:**

#### Option 1: Continue Bootstrapping
**Pros:**
- Maintain 100% ownership
- No dilution or governance complexity
- Organic growth constraints force discipline
- Profitable unit economics proven

**Cons:**
- Slower market penetration
- Risk of well-funded competitor
- Limited resources for marketing and sales
- Can't move as fast in land grab phase

**Best if:** You can reach $1M ARR in 18 months through direct sales and want to maintain control

#### Option 2: Raise Seed/Series A
**Target raise:** $2-5M
**Use of funds:**
- Sales team (40%): 5-7 AEs, 2 SEs, VP Sales
- Marketing (25%): Demand gen, events, content, tools
- Product (20%): Engineering team, feature expansion
- Operations (15%): Customer success, finance, ops

**Pros:**
- Accelerate market penetration
- Build brand faster
- Capture market before competitors
- Hire A-players in sales and engineering

**Cons:**
- 15-25% dilution
- Board seat and governance
- Pressure for hypergrowth
- 18-24 month runway constraints

**Best if:** You see a 2-3 year window to dominate the OTCS AI automation niche before competitors emerge

### Recommended Approach: **Modified Bootstrap**

**Strategy:** Bootstrap for 6-12 months to prove model, then raise if needed

**Milestones to hit before fundraising:**
- 20-30 paying customers
- $100k-200k MRR
- <5% monthly churn
- 3-5 case studies with ROI proof
- Repeatable sales process
- 120%+ Net Revenue Retention

**Why:** Raise at much better valuation with proven traction, maintain optionality

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-3: Design partners, validate model
- Months 4-9: Direct sales, hit $100k MRR
- Months 10-12: Decision point to raise or continue bootstrap
- If raise: Target $5-10M at $30-50M valuation
