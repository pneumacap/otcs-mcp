# Altius — Competitive Positioning Guide

> How to position Altius against alternatives without disparaging potential partners.

---

## Core Positioning Statement

**Altius is the universal automation platform for OpenText Content Server — configure any workflow, any industry, today.**

While solutions like Aviator offer conversational Q&A and simple actions, Altius provides autonomous agents that automate document workflows 24/7 without human intervention. The key differentiator: **AI-driven configuration (not pre-built templates)**. The same platform adapts to legal contracts, finance invoices, healthcare patient records, manufacturing quality docs, and government FOIA requests — simply by changing the agent rules. No custom development. No professional services. No industry-specific SKUs.

**Three competitive advantages:**

1. **Agentic Architecture:** Watched-folder agents run continuously, executing multi-step workflows without humans in the loop
2. **Universal Platform:** 42 OTCS-native tools combine in infinite ways — any workflow, any industry, configured in hours
3. **Works with Any Structure:** Classic folders, virtual folders, Records Management — serves the 60-70% of customers that Business Workspace-dependent solutions cannot reach

This is fundamentally different from traditional automation (RPA, templates, OpenText's multi-platform suite). You describe the workflow. Altius automates it.

## The Agentic Architecture Difference (PRIMARY Differentiator)

### Conversational AI vs Agentic Automation

Most AI solutions for OTCS — including Aviator — are **conversational assistants**:
- User asks a question → AI answers
- User requests an action → AI performs it
- **Human is always in the loop**

Altius includes conversational assistance PLUS **autonomous agents**:
- Agent watches a folder → detects new documents → classifies → extracts data → routes to workflow
- Agent monitors holds → ensures compliance → flags violations → generates reports
- Agent scans contracts → identifies expiring agreements → alerts stakeholders → starts renewal workflows
- **No human in the loop — runs 24/7**

**Why OpenText's Path to Agentic AI is Complex:**

OpenText is building agentic capabilities through a **multi-platform strategy**:

| Platform | Purpose | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Aviator** | Conversational Q&A | Shipping | Base layer |
| **Aviator Studio** | Workflow automation | Separate SKU | Enterprise add-on |
| **Knowledge Discovery** | Data extraction, classification | Separate SKU | Enterprise add-on |
| **AI Data Platform** | AI orchestration layer | Development | Ships ~EOY 2026 |

Each platform requires:
- Separate licensing (enterprise-tier pricing)
- Professional services for integration ($100K-500K+ per platform)
- Multi-vendor coordination (separate support, upgrade cycles)
- 6-12 month deployment timeline for full stack

**Altius delivers comparable functionality in a single integrated platform:**
- One license, one deployment, one support contact
- Days to weeks (not months) to production
- $3,588-108K/year (vs. $500K-2M+ for OpenText stack + services)
- Ships today (not end of 2026)

This isn't a feature gap — it's an **architectural philosophy**. OpenText is building a multi-product suite (classic enterprise strategy). Altius is an integrated platform (modern SaaS strategy). Both approaches have merit, but they serve different buyer profiles and timeline requirements.

## Multi-Platform Suite vs. Integrated Platform (COST & COMPLEXITY)

### The Total Cost of Ownership Story

| Category | OpenText AI Stack | Altius |
|---|---|---|
| **Software licenses** | Aviator + Studio + KD + AI Platform | One Altius subscription |
| **Estimated annual cost** | $500K-2M+ (4 platforms) | $3,588-108K/year |
| **Professional services** | $100-500K per platform integration | $10-75K one-time (implementation) |
| **Time to full deployment** | 6-12 months | Days to weeks |
| **Vendor relationships** | 4+ SKUs, multiple support teams | One vendor, one support team |
| **Upgrade complexity** | 4 platforms, coordinated upgrades | One platform, seamless updates |
| **Integration risk** | High (multi-platform dependencies) | None (integrated by design) |
| **Maintenance burden** | 4 platforms to manage | One platform |

### Sales Messaging by Buyer Type

**For the CIO:**
> "OpenText is building a comprehensive AI suite — Aviator, Aviator Studio, Knowledge Discovery, and the upcoming AI Data Platform. Each is a separate enterprise platform requiring licensing, integration, and professional services. Total cost: $500K-2M+ over 12-18 months. Altius delivers comparable agentic capabilities in a single integrated platform at $12K-108K/year, deployed in weeks. Same outcomes, 10x faster, 1/10th the cost."

**For the CFO:**
> "The OpenText AI roadmap requires 4 platform licenses plus $500K+ in professional services to integrate them. That's a multi-year, multi-million dollar commitment with significant project risk. Altius is $3,588-108K/year with a 90-day pilot — you can validate ROI before making a major commitment."

**For the Business Owner:**
> "You can wait 12-18 months for OpenText to ship and integrate their AI Data Platform, or you can start automating workflows next week with Altius. Every month you wait is another month of manual processing. The opportunity cost of waiting often exceeds the cost of the solution."

**For the OpenText Account Manager:**
> "Your customers are asking about AI. Aviator is a great solution for Business Workspace customers who need conversational assistance. For customers with classic folders who need automation, recommend Altius — it keeps them on OTCS instead of migrating to SharePoint. You can position it as 'AI while you plan your long-term OpenText AI strategy.' It's a land-and-expand play that protects your maintenance revenue."

### The "Good Enough" Positioning

Altius doesn't need to match every feature of the full OpenText AI suite. It needs to be:
- **80% of the capability at 10% of the cost** → obvious choice for most customers
- **10x faster to deploy** → time-to-value matters more than feature parity
- **Simple enough to manage** → no dedicated AI platform team required

By the time OpenText ships the AI Data Platform (EOY 2026) and customers integrate it with Aviator Studio and Knowledge Discovery (12-18 months later), Altius will have:
- 500+ customers
- 2-3 years of feature iteration based on real usage
- Deep integrations with the OTCS ecosystem
- Established brand in the market

**This is classic innovator's dilemma:** OpenText can build a better suite, but Altius can ship faster and iterate based on customer feedback. Speed beats perfection in emerging markets.

## The Business Workspace Requirement (SECONDARY Differentiator)

### What Most People Don't Know About Aviator

OpenText Aviator's AI capabilities require **Business Workspaces** to function. This is not widely advertised, but it's a hard technical requirement.

**What this means:**
- Organizations using classic folders → cannot use Aviator
- Organizations using Virtual Folders → cannot use Aviator
- Organizations with Records Management-first deployments → cannot use Aviator
- Organizations on older OTCS versions (pre-23.4) → cannot use Aviator

### Market Size Implications

**Estimated OTCS installed base split:**

| Deployment Type | % of Customers | Aviator Available? | Altius Available? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Business Workspaces (modern) | 30-40% | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Classic folders (legacy) | 40-50% | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Records Management-first | 10-15% | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Hybrid / Custom | 10-15% | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Yes |

**Our addressable market: 60-70% of the OTCS installed base that Aviator cannot serve.**

## Agentic Use Cases That Aviator Can't Address

### What "Agentic Automation" Means in Practice

| Use Case | Conversational AI (Aviator) | Agentic AI (Altius) |
|---|---|---|
| **Invoice Processing** | User: "Show me unpaid invoices" → AI lists them | Agent watches invoices folder 24/7 → extracts vendor/amount → matches PO → flags mismatches → routes to AP |
| **Contract Compliance** | User: "Which contracts expire in Q1?" → AI searches | Agent monitors contracts folder → identifies expiring agreements → alerts stakeholders 30 days prior → starts renewal workflow |
| **Legal Holds** | User: "Apply hold 2024-03 to these docs" → AI applies | Agent watches litigation folder → auto-applies hold to matching documents → generates custody report daily → alerts if hold removed |
| **Document Classification** | User: "Classify these as invoices" → AI classifies | Agent watches incoming folder → classifies every document automatically → applies metadata → routes to department folder |
| **Retention Management** | User: "Show docs past retention" → AI lists | Agent scans repository weekly → identifies expired records → flags for deletion → generates compliance report |
| **Compliance Reporting** | User: "Generate Q4 compliance report" → AI builds report | Agent runs monthly audit → scans for classification gaps → generates report → emails to compliance team → no user action needed |

**Key Pattern:** Conversational AI requires a user to initiate every action. Agentic AI operates autonomously based on rules and schedules.

### Customer Language

When prospects say: **"We need automation, not just chat"** → That's an agentic use case. Aviator won't solve it.

When prospects say: **"Can it do this while we're offline?"** → That's an agentic use case. Aviator requires user presence.

When prospects say: **"We process 500 documents/day"** → That's an agentic use case. Aviator would require 500 manual interactions.

## Positioning by Stakeholder

### For the OTCS Administrator

**Their question:** "Why not just wait for Aviator?"

**Your answer:**
> "Aviator is excellent for conversational Q&A and simple actions. Altius adds autonomous agents that automate workflows 24/7 — things like monitoring folders for new invoices, classifying contracts, applying holds, routing documents to workflows. This is a different architecture. Aviator focuses on helping users do their jobs faster. Altius focuses on automating the jobs that shouldn't require humans at all. Plus, Aviator requires Business Workspaces; we work with classic folders, virtual folders, or whatever structure you have today."

### For the IT/Procurement Team

**Their question:** "Is this competing with our OpenText investment?"

**Your answer:**
> "Not at all. Altius requires an active OpenText license — you're still paying OpenText maintenance. We're an add-on that makes your existing investment more valuable. Think of us like Microsoft and Salesforce — Microsoft makes Office, Salesforce makes Office better with integrations. We make Content Server better with AI."

### For the OpenText Partner/Reseller

**Their question:** "Why would I sell this instead of Aviator?"

**Your answer:**
> "Because 60% of your installed base can't use Aviator due to the Business Workspace requirement. Every Altius sale is an OpenText customer staying with OpenText instead of migrating to SharePoint or Box. We help you retain accounts that might otherwise churn. Plus, Altius customers still need OpenText support, upgrades, and consulting — we expand your services revenue opportunities."

### For the C-Level Executive

**Their question:** "What's the risk if OpenText builds something that competes with you?"

**Your answer:**
> "OpenText already built Aviator — it requires Business Workspaces, which most customers don't have. They're focused on the modern workspace market. We're focused on the 60-70% of their installed base with legacy structures. Even if they expanded Aviator to classic folders, that's a 2-3 year product roadmap. We're delivering value today. By then, we'll have hundreds of customers and years of competitive moat through feature depth and integrations."

## Messaging Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ DO:

- Emphasize **"works with existing infrastructure"**
- Highlight **"no migration required"**
- Position as **"complementary to OpenText investments"**
- Use **"different architecture for different needs"**
- Talk about **"serving the majority of OTCS customers"**
- Mention **"partner-friendly — helps retain OpenText accounts"**

### ❌ DON'T:

- Say "Aviator doesn't work" (be specific: "requires Business Workspaces")
- Call Aviator "limited" (say "focused on modern workspaces")
- Position as "OpenText competitor" (you're not — you're ecosystem)
- Disparage Business Workspaces (some customers use them)
- Over-promise ("we replace Aviator" — you address different segments)

---

## Partnership Strategy with OpenText

### Why OpenText Should Support Altius

1. **Customer Retention:** Altius keeps 60% of the installed base on OTCS instead of migrating to SharePoint/Box/Dropbox
2. **Maintenance Revenue:** Every Altius customer pays OpenText annual maintenance
3. **Upgrade Path:** Altius increases perceived value of OTCS, making upgrades easier to justify
4. **AI Adoption:** OpenText can claim "AI available for all customers" (via Aviator for BWS users, ecosystem partners like Altius for others)
5. **Services Revenue:** OpenText partners can resell Altius, increasing their services attach rate

### Positioning Altius to OpenText

**Frame:** "We're expanding AI adoption in the OTCS installed base that Business Workspaces doesn't reach."

**Value Props:**
- Reduces migration risk (customers stay on OTCS)
- Expands AI story (coverage beyond Aviator)
- Partner revenue opportunity (reseller channel)
- Ecosystem validation (independent developers building on OTCS)
- No cannibalization (different customer segments)

**Proposed Partnership Models:**

| Type | Description | Benefit to OpenText |
|---|---|---|
| **Technology Alliance** | Co-marketing, joint webinars, "Certified for OTCS" badge | Ecosystem validation, increased AI adoption |
| **Referral Partner** | OpenText refers non-BWS customers to Altius | Revenue share, customer retention |
| **Reseller Channel** | OpenText partners resell Altius as value-add | Partner revenue, services attach |
| **OEM Licensing** | OpenText bundles Altius for non-BWS customers | Competitive differentiation, complete AI coverage |

## Objection Handling

### Objection: "What happens when OpenText ships the AI Data Platform and catches up to Altius?"

**Response:**
> "Great question. OpenText's AI roadmap is public: Aviator (shipped), Aviator Studio (separate SKU), Knowledge Discovery (separate SKU), and AI Data Platform (EOY 2026). To get the full agentic capabilities Altius provides today, customers would need to license and integrate all four platforms — likely a 12-18 month project starting in 2027, with total costs in the $500K-2M range for licenses and professional services.
>
> Even if OpenText ships the AI Data Platform on time and customers integrate it quickly, that's 18-24 months from now. Every month of delay is another month of manual invoice processing, unclassified documents, and compliance gaps. The opportunity cost of waiting typically exceeds the cost of Altius.
>
> By the time OpenText's full stack is integrated and deployed, Altius will have 500+ customers, 2-3 years of feature iteration, and deep OTCS ecosystem integrations. We'll have solved problems OpenText hasn't encountered yet. Plus, many customers will run both — Altius for operational automation, Aviator for Business Workspace-based collaboration. We're complementary, not either-or."

### Objection: "Why not just migrate to Business Workspaces?"

**Response:**
> "For organizations starting fresh or with small repositories, Business Workspaces are great. Most customers we talk to have 10-20 years of folder hierarchies, millions of documents, custom integrations, and hundreds of user-trained workflows. Migrating that to Business Workspaces is a multi-year, multi-million dollar project — essentially rebuilding their entire content architecture. Altius works with what they have, delivering ROI in weeks instead of years."

### Objection: "We're already heavily invested in OpenText. Adding another vendor is a risk."

**Response:**
> "Understood — vendor sprawl is a real concern. A few considerations: First, Altius doesn't replace anything — it enhances your existing OTCS investment. Second, we're protocol-neutral (MCP) and built on open standards, so you're not locked in. Third, our architecture is complementary to OpenText's roadmap, not competitive. Finally, the real risk is your team spending 40-60% of their time on manual OTCS tasks that AI could automate today. The opportunity cost of waiting is often higher than the risk of adding a proven solution."

### Objection: "Can't we just use ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot?"

**Response:**
> "ChatGPT and Copilot are amazing tools, but they can't access Content Server — your OTCS environment is behind your firewall, secured by authentication, and ChatGPT has no way to browse folders, read documents, or execute workflows. Altius provides 42 OTCS-native tools that directly integrate with the REST API. It's the difference between asking someone for directions versus having them drive you there — ChatGPT can give advice, Altius can take action."

## Competitive Intelligence We Track

### Questions to Ask Prospects

1. "Are you currently using Business Workspaces?"
   - If yes: "Aviator may be a fit — have you evaluated it?"
   - If no: "Aviator requires Business Workspaces — Altius is designed for your structure."

2. "What version of Content Server are you on?"
   - Pre-23.4: Aviator not available
   - 23.4+: Aviator available (if BWS enabled)

3. "What's your content structure?"
   - Classic folders: Altius only option
   - Virtual Folders: Altius only option
   - BWS: Both options, emphasize MCP + agent automation

4. "Have you looked at any AI solutions for OTCS yet?"
   - If Aviator came up: "Aviator requires Business Workspaces — is that your structure?"
   - If they tried custom development: "What's been the timeline and cost so far?"
   - If they're using generic AI: "How are you connecting it to OTCS behind the firewall?"

## Key Differentiators (Elevator Pitch)

**30-second version:**
> "Altius is the first AI platform for Content Server that includes autonomous agents — not just chat. While other solutions offer conversational Q&A, Altius adds watched-folder automation that monitors, classifies, and processes documents 24/7 without human intervention. It's the difference between an assistant that answers questions and one that does the work while you sleep. Plus, it works with any OTCS folder structure — not just Business Workspaces."

**2-minute version:**
> "Current AI solutions for OTCS — including Aviator — are conversational assistants. You ask a question, they answer. You request an action, they perform it. This is valuable, but it's fundamentally human-in-the-loop.
>
> Altius does conversational assistance, but we also include autonomous agents that automate document workflows without humans. For example: monitor an invoices folder 24/7, extract vendor/amount/PO from each document, match against purchase orders, flag discrepancies, and route to AP workflow. Or: watch a contracts folder, classify by type and risk, apply retention schedules, and trigger approval workflows for high-value contracts. These agents run continuously — they're processing documents while you sleep.
>
> To get similar agentic capabilities from OpenText, you'd need to license and integrate four separate enterprise platforms: Aviator, Aviator Studio, Knowledge Discovery, and the upcoming AI Data Platform (shipping end of 2026). That's a 12-18 month project with total costs around $500K-2M for licenses and professional services. Altius delivers comparable functionality in a single integrated platform at $12K-108K/year, deployed in days.
>
> Additionally, Altius works with any OTCS folder structure (classic folders, virtual folders, Records Management), while Aviator requires Business Workspaces. This means we can serve the 60-70% of the installed base that other solutions can't reach. We provide 42 OTCS-native tools, work with OTCS 16.x and later, and deploy in days instead of months. One platform, one vendor, one deployment — not a multi-year integration project."
