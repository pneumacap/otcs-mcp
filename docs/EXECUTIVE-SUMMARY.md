# ALTIUS — Executive Summary

**Intelligence at Scale for OpenText Content Server**

---

## The Opportunity

**Market:** 10,000+ OpenText Content Server enterprises waste millions on manual document processing while their $30B ECM investments sit idle. AI automation is now mainstream, but no solution exists purpose-built for OTCS.

**Solution:** Altius transforms passive document repositories into intelligent, autonomous automation platforms through three integrated products: conversational interface, autonomous agents, and developer tools.

**Traction:** Production-ready platform with 41 OTCS tools. Proven ROI: 1,400-7,000% typical returns. Legal discovery: 3-5 days → 2 minutes (99.5% cost reduction). Contract processing: 2-4 weeks → 1 hour (90% time savings).

## Product Overview

| Product | Description | Value Proposition |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Conversational Interface** | Natural language access to all Content Server operations via web browser | Zero training required. "Find contracts expiring in Q1" → instant results with charts |
| **Autonomous Agents** | Monitor folders, classify documents, extract data, execute workflows automatically | ~$0.01-0.03 per document. Processes thousands daily with minimal human intervention |
| **Developer Tools (MCP)** | 41 pre-built integrations for AI agents via Model Context Protocol standard | Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, any MCP-compatible agent |

**Key Differentiator:** Purpose-built for OpenText Content Server — the only OTCS-native AI automation solution.

## Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market:**
- **Primary:** 10,000+ OpenText Content Server enterprises, 5M+ users
- **Secondary:** $30B Enterprise Content Management market
- **Expansion:** $150B+ knowledge worker automation

**Ideal Customer Profile:**
- Company size: 1,000-50,000 employees
- Industries: Healthcare, Financial Services, Legal, Government, Manufacturing
- Pain: High-volume document processing with compliance requirements

**Why Now:**
1. AI is mainstream (post-ChatGPT, enterprises demand practical applications)
2. RPA failed (30-50% project failure rate, $3B+ wasted)
3. ECM needs ROI (10-15 year old deployments, no modernization path)

## Competitive Positioning

**No Direct Competitors in OTCS AI Automation**

| Category | Players | Altius Advantage |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| **RPA Vendors** | UiPath, Automation Anywhere | AI-native, no visual designers needed, 10-50x lower cost |
| **AI Document Processors** | Kofax, ABBYY, Hyperscience | End-to-end workflows, not just extraction |
| **Generic AI Agents** | Zapier AI, Copilot Studio | Deep OTCS integration, compliance-aware, pre-built workflows |
| **OpenText Native** | Extended ECM, AppWorks | Modern stack, weeks not years, 10-50x lower cost |

**The Moat:** First mover advantage + embedded customer workflows = high switching costs. 12-18 month window before large players notice.

## Why This Will Win

### 1. Huge Underserved Market
10,000+ OpenText enterprises with no AI automation solution. $30B spent on ECM with minimal ROI. No path to modernization without Altius.

### 2. Technology Moat
First mover in OTCS AI automation. 41 production-ready tools = 18 months head start. Customer workflows = high switching costs.

### 3. Perfect Timing
AI adoption is mainstream. RPA has failed. OpenText ecosystem partnerships available. No direct competitors (12-18 month window).

### 4. Proven Business Model
SaaS with land-and-expand dynamics. High-margin services revenue. Clear path to profitability.

### 5. Measurable Impact
60-80% cost reduction (quantifiable). 70-80% cycle time improvement (immediate). 90% error reduction (compliance win). Payback in 1-2 months (obvious ROI).
