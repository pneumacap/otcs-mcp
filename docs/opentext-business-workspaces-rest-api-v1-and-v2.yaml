      description: >-
        Creates or updates business workspaces. This call is used for automatic creation. 
        Update is not supported for a business workspace without business object. The 
        properties of the *bws_infos* entries are supported as it is done with the REST 
        call HTTP POST */v2/businessworkspaces* and the properties are evaluated in the context of 
        automatic creation: 
          - *parent_id*: The parameter is ignored. It is only evaluated for manual creation
          - *ibo_workspace_id*: The parameter is ignored. It is only evaluated for manual creation
          
        The fast bulk method is supported except:
          - if a business workspace is created and the property *roles* contains 
            a further role other than *categories* like *import_team*.
          - if a business workspace with business object is created and relations with 
            relation type *CompositeParent* or *CompositeChild* are provided.
         
        If business workspaces are detected to be created with the fast bulk method then 
        they are created using a single transaction. If at least one of the business 
        workspaces cannot be created then the business workspaces are created individually 
        using a single transaction for each one of them with fast bulk mode and the REST call 
        returns individual error messages for each business workspace which cannot be created.
         
        The supported properties in the *body* are optional. If the property *bo_type_id* is 
        not provided, then the business object type ID is calculated from the values of *bo_type* 
        and *ext_system_id*. If the property *template_id* is not provided, then the workspace 
        template ID is calculated from the values of *bo_type_id* and *bo_id*. If the property 
        *template_id* is provided, then the workspace type ID is calculated from the value 
        of *template_id*.
         
        Example to create two business workspaces without business object. The location setting of the 
        workspace type is set to *Current Location*. The name generation is disabled to be used for

      summary: Creates or updates a business workspace.
      description: >-
        Creates or updates a business workspace. This call is used for manual creation. Update 
        is only supported for a business workspace with business object by providing the property 
        *ibo_workspace_id*. The fast bulk method is not supported. 
         
        The supported properties in the *body* are optional. If the property *bo_type_id* is 
        not provided, then the business object type ID is calculated from the values of *bo_type* 
        and *ext_system_id*. If the property *template_id* is not provided, then the workspace 
        template ID is calculated from the values of *bo_type_id* and *bo_id*. If the property 
        *template_id* is provided, then the workspace type ID is calculated from the value 
        of *template_id*.
         
        Example to create a business workspace without business object. The location setting of the 
        workspace type is set to *Current Location*. The name generation is disabled to be used for 
        business workspaces without business object.

            "name": "Customer"
          }
          ```
        Example to create a business workspace without business object providing a category value and 
        importing the participants of the roles from another business workspace. The location setting 
        of the workspace type is set to *Content Server Folder* and is enabled to be used for manual 
        creation. The name generation is disabled to be used for business workspaces without business 
        object.
